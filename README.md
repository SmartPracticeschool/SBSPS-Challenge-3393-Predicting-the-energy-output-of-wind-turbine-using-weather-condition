# SBSPS-Challenge-3393-Predicting-the-energy-output-of-wind-turbine-using-weather-condition
Description of Project
Wind energy plays an increasing role in the supply of energy world-wide. The energy output of a wind farm is highly dependent on the wind conditions present at its site. If the output can be predicted more accurately, energy suppliers can coordinate the collaborative production of different energy sources more efficiently to avoid costly overproduction.
Solution Offered through this project
We analyzed the data for a Windmill Farm and extracted the weather parameters (assuming other physical conditions like weight of blades, height of windmill to be same etc) that affect power generation the most. Then we prepared an ML model taking the obtained features in consideration, using Boosted Regressor Tree Model. Then for provinding solution quicker to the end-user, we made an Web app to obtain power predictions of next 72 hours on hourly basis in single click.

Technology Stack Used
IBM Watson Notebook (Python3) for Data Preprocessing, Python3 for ML model making and Flutter for front-end app development and Flask for back-end and integration with the model.
